My github is sad and unloved at the moment :'( Check back in winter 2021 when it is finally shown the love it so desperately needs and deserves..  
Update on 1-2-2022 : Am actively cleaning through old junk repositories, updating all applicable repos to use a standardized repo and ReadME format/structure, and adding many new repositories for various projects of mine.
